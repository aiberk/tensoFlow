# Notes

## Processing Data

- Clean data (convert to numerical values, remove outliers, etc.)
- Normalize data (scale data to be between 0 and 1)
- Shuffle data (randomize order of data)
- Feature selection (select most important features)
- Feature engineering (create new features)
- Data bias (make sure data is representative of population)

## Gathering Trainging & Testing Data

### Strategy A

- 80% training, 20% testing
- Train model on data set -> test model on test set -> evaluate model -> repeat
- pick a model that performs best on test set

### Strategy B

- 70% training, 15% validation, 15% testing
- Train model on training set -> test model on validation set -> evaluate model -> repeat
- pick a model that performs best on validation set
- Confirm model on test set
